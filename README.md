## A Seniors' Ministry
 **WHEREAS** 
 

* Canadian society is aging rapidly and seniors make up almost 16% of our population; this number is expected to grow to 24% by 2030; 

* this trend will have a profound impact on our health care system, social services, and the economy;

* seniors are a diverse group of individuals with a wide range of capabilities, needs, vulnerabilities and resources; 

* seniors, like other Canadians, deserve the highest possible quality of life and personal dignity;

* seniors' issues are currently shared between a number of ministers and government departments, committees, and agencies; 

* this fragmentation means that seniors do not have a dedicated voice to represent their rights and interests; 

* the amalgamation of responsibility for seniors under one dedicated minister would result in a clear vision and coordinated approach to seniors' needs, systemic and cost efficiencies, and consistency in program development and implementation across the country; 

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada strongly urge the Government of Canada to establish a dedicated Ministryof Seniors, with a mandate to: 

* consult and engage with Canada's seniors; 

* protect and vigorously promote the needs and interests of seniors as well as the value of seniors to civil society; 

* establish a national seniors strategy that defines common goals and standards from coast to coast to coast; 

* liaise with provincial, territorial, municipal, and Indigenous counterparts on areas of mutual concern or overlapping jurisdiction including but not limited to health care, housing, income security, home care, long term care, pharmacare, social isolation, elder abuse, and ageism; and

* develop national standards and monitoring protocols for seniors' programs.(Alberta)

 ------------------- 

## Address the Opioid Crisis through a Public Health Approach
 **WHEREAS** 
 

* almost 3,000 Canadians died from opioid-related causes in 2016, and it is estimated that the number will surpass 3,000 in 2017; 

* our Liberal government has restored harm reduction as a key pillar of Canada’s drug strategy, saved lives by passing Bill C-37 and facilitating the approval of more supervised consumption sites, and regulated cannabis as part of our commitment to evidence-based decision-making;

* in 2001, Portugal took two broad measures to combat the harms associated with drug abuse: first, Portuguese policymakers significantly expanded treatment and harm reduction services; and second, they eliminated criminal penalties for low-level possession and consumption of all illicit drugs and reclassified these activities as administrative violations;

* since 2001, a person found in possession of personal-use amounts of any drug in Portugal is no longer arrested, but ordered to appear before a dissuasion commission comprised of representatives from law, medicine, and social work, which can refer a person to a voluntary treatment program, or impose administrative sanctions;

* since 2001, in Portugal, the number of deaths from drug overdose has dropped significantly, adolescent and problematic drug use has decreased, the number of people in drug treatment has increased, the number of people arrested and sent to criminal courts has declined by 60%, and the per capital social cost of drug misuse has decreased by 18%.

**BE IT RESOLVED**  the Government of Canada should treat drug abuse as a health issue, expand treatment and harm reduction services and re-classify low-level drug possession and consumption as administrative violations.(National Caucus)

 ------------------- 

## Affordable Housing 
 **WHEREAS** 
  

* residents in Canada have the right to affordable housing, regardless of ethnicity, cultural background, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, or disability; 

* students, women, and Indigenous people face particular challenges in finding clean, safe and affordable housing;

* there is an acute shortage of affordable public and non-market housing for those of lower income;  

* those of lower income fear housing security is not reliable or robust enough to meet current needs;  

* many housing complexes were constructed without fully accessible suites;  

* the building and development industry does not design or engineer residential housing for ready conversion for accessibility inside and outside the residence; 

* the present federal government has shown great leadership in developing a national housing strategy; 

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada urge the Government of Canada to: 

* institute a funding program to modify existing non-market housing complexes to meet current health, safety, and accessibility codes

* support the principle that the total cost of public non-market housing for lower income residents of Canada should not exceed 30% of their gross annual income.   (Alberta)

 ------------------- 

## Canadian Environmental Bill of Rights
 **WHEREAS** 
 

* on June 16, 2010, all Liberal Members of Parliament present in the House of Commons voted in favor of Bill C-469 (40-3), an Act to Establish a Canadian Environmental Bill of Rights, to “safeguard the right of present and future generations of Canadians to a healthy and ecologically balanced environment”;

* in a 2015 report, the International Institute for Sustainable Development calculated poor air quality resulted in the premature death of 7,700 Canadians and smog cost Canada $36 billion; 

* the United Nations (UN) recognizes environmental rights as a basic human right, and on March 7, 2016, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights concluded that Canada has failed to provide adequate environmental protection; 

* tens of thousands of synthetic chemicals now contaminate our air, water, soil, food, and homes, with some of those chemicals linked to increasing incidences of certain chronic diseases; 

* new technologies are being used with few independent, peer-reviewed studies and no transparent, inclusive, in-depth discussion on possible environmental and health impacts;

* experts at the Université du Québec à Montréal, the David Suzuki Foundation and stakeholders across Canada contributed to the preparation of this resolution;

**BE IT RESOLVED**  the Liberal Party of Canada urge the Government of Canada to enact legislation establishing a Canadian Environmental Bill of Rights, whose purpose is to ensure all Canadians have access to adequate environmental information, justice in an environmental context and effective mechanisms for participating in environmental decision-making in accordance with the provisions of Bill C-469 (40-3).(Women’s Commission)

 ------------------- 

## Canadian Oil & Gas Independence 
 **WHEREAS** 
  

* the oil and gas sector is a key industry for Canada and an integral part of national economic growth and job creation; 

* interprovincial pipeline construction presents an opportunity for nation-building and Canadian infrastructure development; 

* Canada imported roughly 759,000 barrels and 736,000 barrels of oil per day, in 2016 and 2015 respectively, despite Canada having among the largest oil and gas reserves in the world, capable of meeting all Canadian oil and gas needs; 

* Canadian oil and gas independence would allow Canada to ensure that domestic natural resource extraction and usage would be carried out more efficiently, safely, and sustainably than in countries which export oil and gas to Canada; 

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada urge the government to: 

* implement a strategy for oil and gas independence, with particular attention to:ostrong environmental and safety regulations, and oversight of the oil and gas sectoronational job creation and economic growth; and orespect for the rights and interests of Indigenous Peoples 

* Consult with all provinces, territories, First Nations, Métis, Inuit, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, and all other relevant stakeholders in developing acceptable infrastructure and pipelines necessary for oil and gas independence.   (Alberta)

 ------------------- 

## Decriminalization of Consensual Sex Work and Sex Trade
 **WHEREAS** 
 

* the current Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act, which prohibits the purchasing of sex, does little to protect sex workers and instead pushes them to work underground and in dangerous conditions;

* the current prohibition of buying consensual sex work does not address the underlying issues that make sex work dangerous, but rather creates a climate that makes sex workers unlikely to work with the police and be involved with more serious crimes;

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada repeal the 2014 Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act, begin a consultation period with those in the sex work industry and advocacy groups, and move to decriminalize consensual sex work, and the purchase of said sex work, for those over the age of 18;

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada consult not just with those involved in the sex work, but with surrounding communities to ensure that these changes ensure the safety and wellbeing of these surrounding communities and their families;

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED** that along with decriminalization the Liberal Party of Canada should look to address the true problems facing sex workers by working to increase their access to sexual health clinics, counseling and improve their relationship with local authorities.(Youth Commission)

 ------------------- 

## Employee Pension Protection Strategy 
 **WHEREAS** 
 

* some employers have failed to fulfill their commitment to Employee Pension Plans, depriving employees of future retirement income in addition to the loss of part or all their current contributions; 

* private pensions should be the responsibility of the commercial enterprises making the commitment, not the taxpayer; 

* the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Actand the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Actprovide “super-priority” to numerous obligations over Employee Pension Plans; 

* the Supreme Court of Canada has favoured the payments of these “super-priority” creditors even at the expense of the original Employee Pension Plan Agreements, giving paramountcy to a flawed insolvency law over any provincial recognition of pension rights; 

* the previous government, recognizing the unjust treatment some Canadians faced with private defined benefit pensions, granted current year pension contributions super-priority status in the Wage Earner Protection Program; 

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada urges the Government of Canada to develop and implement an Employee Pension Protection Strategy by: 

* Prioritizing Employee Pension Plans in the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Actand the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Actto recognize super-priority for pension debts

* Reforming current federal legislation with the aim of protecting Employee Pension Plans during insolvency proceedings. 

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada call upon the Government of Canada to consult with stakeholders, organizations, and third parties in its development of the aforementioned strategy.(Ontario)

 ------------------- 

## End Taxation on MenstrualProducts
 **WHEREAS** 
 

* Menstrual products are essential for person’s wellbeing and a monetary burden should not infringe on their self-autonomy or hinder their ability to buy vital products;

* Peopleshould not face gender-based discrimination from a government;

* Revenue for the government has increased despite suppliers being eligible for NAFTA’s tariff-free status because companies from the US choose not to applyfor tariff-freestatus.

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Canadian government pass legislation to remove tariff code taxes off of essential menstrualproducts.(Youth Commission)

 ------------------- 

## Endorsing the United Nations Treaty to Ban Nuclear Weapons
 **WHEREAS** 
 

* under Article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (1970), Canada has a solemn obligation, under international law, to press for worldwide elimination of nuclear weapons;

* for the past 20 years, nuclear weapons have been the only weapons of mass destructionnot yet banned by international agreement (cf. Biological Weapons Convention, 1975; Chemical Weapons Convention, 1997);

* in December 2015, the United Nations General Assembly initiated a process to negotiate a legal ban on nuclear weapons;

* on April 7, 2017, Canadians for a Nuclear Weapons Convention, an organization of over 900 Order of Canada recipients, called on the Government of Canada to endorse “a verifiable treaty on the prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons”;

* on July 7, 2017, 122 countries approved the text of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which will be open for signature at United Nations Headquarters in New York as of September 20, 2017, and will be in force once 50 countries have acceded to it;

* experts at the University of Waterloo and member groups of the Canadian Network to Abolish Nuclear Weapons were consulted in drafting this resolution;

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada urge the Government of Canada, during its current mandate, to sign and ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.(Women’s Commission)

 ------------------- 

## Environmental Sustainability
 **WHEREAS** 
 

* senior Registered Liberals across Canada identified through the 2017 SLC PolicyQuestionnaire the need for “government leadership in addressing all aspects ofenvironmental sustainability, including air, water, and land, not just climate change andnot just mitigation” as a priority issue for consideration during the next federal electioncampaign;

* the federal government has prioritized reducing the impact of greenhouse gas emissionson the global climate;

* numerous studies, such as the Brundtland report titled “Our Common Future”, suggestthat the current pace and nature of global economic activity is not environmentallysustainable ;

* other studies, such as Dietz and O’Neil’s hypothesis contained in “Enough is Enough-Building a Sustainable Economy in a World of Finite Resources”, suggest that a largerproportion of the global population could achieve a middle-class lifestyle with a reducedimpact on the environment;

**BE IT RESOLVED** that the Liberal Party of Canada urge the Government of Canada:

* to accept that it must provide active leadership to set and achieve goals for long termenvironmental sustainability, including air, water, land, habitat, and speciesdiversification in addition to climate change;

* to recognize that such leadership will require changes in individual, corporate andgovernment behaviour and attitudes;

* to work urgently with individual, corporate and indigenous stakeholders to identify andimplement new economic development models that better balance environmentalsustainability with economic activity(Seniors Commission)

 ------------------- 

## Implementation of a Guaranteed Minimum Income Model  
 **WHEREAS** 
  

* almost 5 million Canadians live in poverty; 

* the gap between the highest and lowest incomes continues to grow with each passing year;  

* some economists believe that maintaining growth in industrialized countries requires a narrowing of this gap to stimulate household consumption;  

* technological advances, and in particular advances in artificial intelligence, will lead to the loss of many skilled and unskilled jobs; 

* people who lose their jobs will have to retrain, perhaps several times in their lives; 

* a guaranteed minimum income would constitute an unconditional source of income, which could be used by everyone as he or she sees fit;  

* according to some studies, the guaranteed minimum income could replace other provincial and federal government benefitsand would require less administrative work, particularly because of the lack of controls;  

* a pilot project on Guaranteed Minimum Income is currently underway in Ontario and a similar project is being considered in Québec and other Canadian provinces; 

* the federal government could intervene in this jurisdiction, as it did for universal health insurance;

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Government of Canada:

* review past and ongoing pilot projects, as well as studies carried out by academic experts on the subject

* work with the provinces to develop a universal, equitable and sustainable guaranteed minimum income model for the benefit of all Canadians;

* inform and consult with the public on the implementation of this model. (Quebec)

* accessible fully funded mental health programs and services have been advocated by many for years;

* examples of effective community based mental health services exist and have resulted in effective care;

* studies of effective services to treat mental illness through co-management of mental and physical ailments, where appropriate, has resulted in recovery rates of 60%;

* the sponsors of this resolution researched the literature and held public consultations with 99.5% of respondents supporting this Resolution.

## Infrastructure and Connecting Canadians via a Fixed Link
 **WHEREAS** 
  

* the Island of Newfoundland depends on ferry service for access to goods and services and travel for visitors to or from the Island;

* weather and ice can lead and has led to significant delays;

* mechanical problems with aging ferryfleets can lead and has led to significant delay;

* such delays cause expensive disruptions to businesses, communities, individuals, and governments; and can increase the cost of goods, including food;

* Prince Edward Island was connected to mainland Canada two decades ago;

* technology has advanced significantly, as evidenced by recent construction of long-distance subsea tunnels in Norway;

* providing a fixed link between the Island of Newfoundland would better connect the province of Newfoundland and Labrador and all Canadians;

* construction of such a project would be a major economic stimulus;

* such a link would provide ongoing benefits to NL and other provinces along the transit route (e.g., Quebec) from more reliable transportation alternatives and the potential for increased tourism

## Leave to Study Program 
 **WHEREAS** 
 

* the Government of Canada continues to invest in and helps Canadians gain the skills, abilities, and experience needed to find and maintain good employment;  

* the skills needed in our Canadian labour market continue to change and require advancement in literacy, numeracy, and critical thinking skills;

* there should be opportunities for workers to pursue further education and skills training while advancing their careers through employment; 

* the Office of Literacy and Essential Skills under Employment and Social Development Canada recognizes that literacy and other such skills are needed for Canadians to succeed in their employment and in other walks of life; 

**BE IT RESOLVED**  the Liberal Party of Canada urge the Government of Canada to establish a “leave to study” program, which may be defined as the option of employees who have been employed with an employer (of a prescribed size) for 12 months to take a leave of absence for further study directly related to their work;  

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED** that qualifying applicants to such a program receive financial remuneration through the Employment Insurance program for six months, with or without contribution from the employer; 

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED** that Employment and Social Development Canada shall operate the program under joint agreement with provincial ministries of labour with the goal of advancing the priorities of each province; 

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED** that the initiation of such a program may include a pilot program in each or any province or territory under Part V of the Employment Insurance Act. (Ontario)

 ------------------- 

## Modernize and Integrate Canada’s Energy Grid
 **WHEREAS** 
 

* a modern integrated Canadian energy grid will enable greater energy efficiency, reliability and affordability for Canadians; 

* the creation of a modern Canadian energy grid will be fundamental to supporting Canada’s future clean energy based economy, while also creating immediate jobs needed to complete power-line connections and computerized system upgrades; 

* the International Energy Agency has estimated that Canada’s electricity sector will require $250 billion in new investment by 2030;

* a modern integrated Canadian energy grid will enable fossil fuel dependent provinces to transition toward clean energy as a primary energy source; 

* mass market adoption of electric vehicles is projected within a decade and Canada will require a de-carbonized modern electricity grid to support the transition away from fossil fuel powered vehicles to meet the Paris Agreement on climate change;

* Canada is working closely with European partners to address climate change while modernized energy grids are a proven and fundamental element of the European Union’s energy strategy to reduce costs and meet climate change targets; 

**BE IT RESOLVED**  the Liberal Party of Canada urge the Government of Canada to promote and commit to the creation of a modern integrated Canadian energy grid.(Manitoba)

 ------------------- 

## Name Change for “Commissioner”
 **WHEREAS** 
  

* the title of “Commissioner” has been commonly (though not exclusively)used by Canada for the Chief Executive Officers of the territorial governments (the role that in the Provinces today is called the “Lieutenant Governor”);

* in the early days of territories in Canada, between 1869 and 1905, the title “Lieutenant Governor” was used for the Chief Executive Officer of Rupert’s Land and North-Western Territory (1869-1870), Manitoba and the North-West Territories (1870-1876) and the North-West Territories (1876-1905);

* the political evolution of territories has been consistent with the evolution of Provinces in the federation;

* the territories have mature governments with “administration and control” of the same areas of jurisdiction normally associated with Provinces in Canada (Nunavut is actively working on transfer of lands and resources which have been finished in Yukon and the Northwest Territories);

* the Commissioners have, since the 1980s, been accepted in the “Vice-Regal Club” of the Governor General and Provincial Lieutenant Governors; 

* the role of Commissioner is officially described in the Government of Canada publication Commissioners of the Territories(Ottawa, 2000) as “…the commissioner’s role has become more like that of a lieutenant governor of a province”;

* the Commissioners, because of the title, are often confused with the many other Officers of government with “Commissioner” in the title (e.g. Commissioner of Official Languages; Information Commissioner of Canada; Commissioner of Environment and Sustainable Development etc.); 

**BE IT RESOLVED** :

* Canada change the title of “Commissioner” to “Territorial Lieutenant Governor” which more appropriately reflects the nature of the Office and the maturity of the territories in the Canadian federation; 

* this change in title takes place as soon as possible through Prime Ministerial recognition as a working title in advance of legislation that will recognize this name change through amendments to the territorial constitutions: Yukon Act, Northwest Territories Act and Nunavut Act.  (Yukon) 

 ------------------- 

## National On-Campus Sexual Assault Prevention Strategy
 **WHEREAS** 
 

* In 2016 Canadian universities reported that less than 10% of sexual assault complaints were followed by a formal investigation;

* There is not a national standard on sexual assault policy on post-secondary campuses in Canada, causing many victims of sexual violence at post-secondary institutions to internalize their trauma or leave the institution;

* Only three provinces have mandated sexual violence on campus policies, leaving young Canadiansin other provinces vulnerable;

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Canadian government create a National On-Campus Sexual Assault Strategy to reduce the percentage of acts of sexual violence on post-secondary campuses, to create a mandatory formal procedure for post-secondary administrations to follow after the initial report of sexual violence, and to work towards ensuring a safe climate for Canadians to earn their education in.(Youth Commission)

 ------------------- 

## National Three-Oceans Policy for Security,Environmental Protection and Development
 **WHEREAS** 
 

* Canada has the longest coastline of any country in the world, fronting on three oceans, and four great lakes;

* Canada needs to reaffirm its position as a leading state in sustainable oceanic research, anddevelopment;

* Canada's capacity for oceanic and Arctic scientific research has been diminished by a failure to renew our oceanographic research vessels;

* high capacity submarine fiber optics telecommunications cables are currently being laid to connect Europe and Asia, through the Canadian Arctic without provision of access by the Canadian Government or Canadian Arctic communities, which are restricted to slow and expensive satellite internet services;

* the current national ocean policy "Canada's ocean strategy" needs to be updated to reflect the realities of today.

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Canadian government:

* commission a 21st century comprehensive integrated three-Oceans Policy, including environmental protection, economic and social development, scientific research, sovereignty and security;

* implement a strategy to re-establish Canada's oceanographic research capabilities, including acquiring oceanographic research vessels for the short, medium, and long term;

* for purposes of security, sovereignty and Arctic community development, make full access to telecommunications (internet) capacity a requirement for any trans-Arctic telecommunications cables transiting through Canada's Arctic waters.(Nova Scotia)

 ------------------- 

## Post-Secondary Education and Labour Market Partnership
 **WHEREAS** 
 

* the federal government has access to data pertaining to labour market trends;

* the government has undertaken an Atlantic Growth Strategy dedicated to building a vibrant economic future for Atlantic Canada;

* thesuccessful implementation of this strategy will result in youth retention, job growth, and attraction to Atlantic Canada.

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada urges the Government of Canada to adopt a pilot to support Atlantic post-secondary education institutions in partnering with industry and employers to match programming and students with labour market trends and job opportunities in the region.(Nova Scotia)

 ------------------- 

## Post-Secondary Funding and Economic Development
 **WHEREAS** 
  

* an educated labour force is critical for economic development, developing new industries, and creating jobs;

* many rural regions of Canada face a shortage of educated labourers in necessary sectors;

* diversification of industries and sources of employment is important for sustainable economic growth, particularly in rural regions;

## Protecting Freshwater Resources -Export and Marketing 
 **WHEREAS** 
  

* water is an essential resource for the lives of Canadians;  

* Canada has more than 7% of the world's renewable water;  

* no federal program outlines export and marketing regulation;  

* the conservation of the' natural water' resource is enshrined in the Canada Water Resources Act, but the export and marketing of freshwater remains a gap in discussions on international agreements, pacts or treaties; 

* the management of border resources must be based on agreements between the various levels of government of each member country to determine the non-market value of water and ensure that it is not exported for profit between the Boundary Waters Treaty (BWT) countries;  

* the federal government recognizes the authority of the provinces and municipalities to manage aquatic resources; 

* several world organizations predict that by 2025 some 34 countries will run out of water; 

* there will be strong pressure in the coming years to export water to countries experiencing drought and a lack of drinking water (United States and the Middle East). 

**BE IT RESOLVED** Canada recognize freshwater as a Canadian Heritage asset and grant the status as a resource to exercise full sovereignty;  

**BE IT RESOLVED** to regulate ecosystem conservation for current and future populations, steps be taken to determine federal governance with the provinces to justify nonmarket management of this resource (freshwater) and conservation of fresh water supplies.  (Quebec)

* the Canadian Dairy Commission is a Crown corporation established in 1966 with a mandate to coordinate federal and provincial dairy policies and create a dairy production control mechanism to stabilize revenues and avoid costly surplus production; 

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada establish a working group to develop solutions to protect the supply management system and to modernize the Canadian Dairy Commission. 

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED** the recommendations of this task force will be sent to the Right Honourable PrimeMinister, his Cabinet and all Members of Parliament to serve as a strategic vision for the Government of Canada to promote the supply management system. (Quebec)

* waitlists for specialists and surgical procedures are among the highest they have ever been, with significant regional disparities, including for rural areas and indigenous peoples;

* in 2017, the International Commonwealth Fund ranked Canada’s health care ninth among eleven high-income countries;

* the Federal Government commissioned the Advisory Panel on Health Care Innovation, (2015) chaired by Dr. David Naylor, to identify “areas of innovation that have potential to sustainably reduce growth in health spending while leading to improvements in the quality and accessibility of care”;

* the panel reported Canadian healthcare “in crisis”, and identified numerous areas for systemic improvement;

* in 2017 a majority of senior Registered Liberals identified an urgent need for:obetter access to family doctors and healthcare servicesoreduced wait times for specialists and medical proceduresoinnovation for service delivery efficiency and cost reduction; 

**BE IT RESOLVED**  the Liberal Party of Canada urge the federal government to:

* accept the Naylor Report's recommendations to lead systemic reform of healthcare;

* in cooperation with provinces, territories, and professional organizations, identify and implement methods to: 

* provide every Canadian access to family physician supervised primary care

* eliminate wait times to access specialists and surgical procedures that adversely affect Canadian’s health

* foster continuing innovation to reduce costs, enhance efficiency and ensure consistent health caredelivery throughout Canada;

* Report regularly to Canadians on progress toward achieving the above improvements including data based on patient-derived metrics. (Seniors’Commission) (British Columbia)

## Redressing Tax Avoidance
 **WHEREAS** 
 

* Profit shifting tax avoidance schemes, such as the use of tax havens, result in:oErosion of the national tax baseoIncreasing government deficits

* A concentration of wealth and power;

* Redressing tax avoidance involves resolving the problems of:o competition among countries for corporate investmento profit shifting to tax havens;

* According to the organization Canadians for Tax Fairness, Canadian tax losses due to taxhavens range from $10 to $15 billion a year;

* Tax Justice Network estimates that globally governments are losing tax revenues of:o$500bn a year due to profit shifting tax avoidance by corporationso$200bn a year due to undeclared offshore wealth of individuals;

* Mechanisms for moving corrupt money, criminal money and commercial tax-avoiding money are the same;

* Concerted international action is essential to redressing tax avoidance;

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada urge the Government of Canada to redress tax avoidance by working internationally to eliminate tax avoidance strategies through such measures as:

* Public registries of the actual (beneficial) owners of companies, trusts, etc..

* Public country-by-country reporting requirements for all multinationals, in order to tax profits in the countries where they originated

* Establishing an intergovernmental body at the United Nations to negotiate a globalagreement to eliminate tax havens and redress tax avoidance.(Women’s Commission)

## Removing Barriers to Conditional Sentence Orders
 **WHEREAS** 
  

* the conditional sentence order (“CSO”), also known as house arrest, was enacted by the Liberal government in 1995 to help correct Canada’s overreliance on incarceration, in particular for Indigenous offenders, as a method to deter crime;

* the amendments to restrict the availability of a CSO, enacted in 2008 and 2012, have contributed to increased litigation, delay and costs in the criminal justice system;

* the amendments to restrict the availability of a CSO disproportionately affects offenders who are vulnerable people in society by forcing the judicial system to impose incarceration on offenders who are young, Indigenous or refugee, and unlikely to reoffend with proper community resources;

* the Canadian taxpayers save approximately $50,000.00 per year for a person serving a CSO as compared to incarceration;

**BE IT RESOLVED**  the Liberal Party of Canada urge the Government of Canada to amend the criminal code to allow greater flexibility to impose conditional sentence orders, in particular for non-violent offences.(Manitoba)

## Renewable Energy Tax Credit
 **WHEREAS** 
 

* the 30% Investment Tax Credit for solar and other renewable technologies and 2.3 cent per kilowatt hour Production Tax Credit for wind power in consortwith state incentives have spurred a 300 % increase in wind power and 123% increase in the solar industry over the past decade;

* California solar employers overwhelmingly cite the federal tax credits as substantially contributing to their firms’ success;

* in Canada investment in clean energy investment in 2015 dropped 46%;

* for every million dollars invested in renewable energy 17 jobs are created, compared with 5 for fossil fuel investment;

* Canadian corporations are sitting on an estimated $600 billion in cash (32% of GDP) that could be invested in clean energy, with the right incentives;

* the Americans have proven that major investment in renewable energies encouraged by tax incentives builds the economy and creates jobs without increasing our carbon footprint.

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada strongly encourage the Government of Canada to create a made in Canada Tax Credit Program to drive wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass investment, as well as other renewable energy sources fashioned after the Obama plan of 2015.(Manitoba)

 ------------------- 

## Restorative Justice
 **WHEREAS** 
 

* there is strong support for the principles, values and operational initiatives in developing services based on restorative justice approaches; 

* arestorative justice approach should be the first priority in dealing with justice issues. Incarceration and social control mechanisms should be used only after restorative justice approaches are not successful, or not applicable; 

* all justice personnel, including personnel in closed custody, should be selected, educated and committed to restorative justice principles and approaches. Continuing seminars and educational opportunities will need to be developed for staff to sustain this restorative approach; 

* it will be necessary to develop systems and infrastructure that will form the basis of our service on restorative principles;

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada develop a comprehensive policy on Restorative Justice.(Saskatchewan)

 ------------------- 

## Suicide Prevention Strategy
 **WHEREAS** 
 

* more than 1 in 4 Canadians will be affected by mental health issues;

* suicide is the leading cause of death among young adults in Canada;

* persons undergoing treatment for mental health issues require broad support; 

* those close to persons affected by mental health issues are also impacted; 

**BE IT RESOLVED** a Liberal Government consult on and develop a comprehensive suicide prevention strategy.   (Saskatchewan)

 ------------------- 

## Supporting Innovations for Local Food Production
 **WHEREAS** 
  

* many parts of Canada, especially rural and remote areas, are heavily dependent on food imports;

* processed foods have longer shelf lives and are easier to transport, and are connected to rising rates of obesity and rates of obesity-related illnesses;

* local production of food enhances reliable access to foodstuffs, reduces transportation costs and greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, reduces foods wastage and spoilage, and can reduce food insecurity;

* local production of food can provide meaningful employment opportunities, particularly in rural and remote areas that are suffering economically, and can provide enhanced access to fresh (non-processed) foods;

* prolonged environmental assessments and governmental approvals for agriculture and aquaculture industries can delay development, which is particularly disadvantageous in remote and rural areas with low employment rates and a lack of local food production

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada encourages the Government of Canada to: 

* develop a plan for all jurisdictions to have a locally grown food supply that would maximize the use of local labour and local resources and minimize regulatory hurdles;

* consider new methods and technologies of food production that would support northern, rural, and remote communities in increasing local food production.(Newfoundland and Labrador)

 ------------------- 

## Tax Recovery from Offshore Havens
 **WHEREAS** 
 

* the sponsors of this resolution consulted academics from Laval and York Universities, investigative journalists, taxpayers’ advocates, a wide variety of research publications; and reviewed recommendations of the Standing Committee on Finance in the report The Canada Revenue Agency -Tax Avoidance and Tax Evasion in preparation of this resolution;

* tax avoidance and tax evasion are direct infringements on fairness as the core principle of taxation;

* fairness in taxation is vital to maintaining democratic cohesion;

* Statistics Canada estimates the cost of tax avoidance due to offshore tax havens at between $6.0B and $7.8B yearly;

* the government estimates that tax avoidance by Canadian corporations and wealthy individuals totals $255B with roughly two thirds attributable to abuse of tax havens and one third to wealthy individuals exploiting tax loopholes;

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada urge the Government of Canada to continue to introduce legislation to eliminate existing tax loopholes and to recover taxes from offshore tax havens;

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada urge the Government of Canada to applyhigher penalties in addition to the recuperation of unpaid tax from corporations and individualsand that criminal sanctions be provided for third parties who promote offshore tax avoidance schemes to clients; 

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada urge the Government of Canada to signal clearly that existing and new legislation will be rigorously enforced to prevent tax avoidance and evasion by providing adequate and stable funding to the CRA.(British Columbia)

## The Need for Stable, Quality Jobs -The Key to a Stronger Middle Class
 **WHEREAS** 
  

* Senior Registered Liberals across Canada identified the need for “stronger governmentefforts to create stable, quality jobs for all Canadians, with an emphasis on creating realopportunities for the younger generations” as a priority issue ;

* Statistics Canada estimates that the Canadian economy has lost 7% of its mid-skilledjobs during the past 10 years, resulting in a decline in median incomes during the pastdecade;

* Manymiddle-aged workers displaced by these losses have been forced to take lowerlevel part-time jobs with limited benefits. Similarly, many younger, well-educatedCanadians are also forced to take lower level part-time jobs that do not supportprogress toward a middle class life-style;

* While Canada has supported innovation through education, R&D, and tax incentives,there is limited evidence that such innovations translate into a sufficient number ofquality jobs for Canadians; and

* Other countries such as China, Germany and South Korea provide models of cooperation among government, industry and academia leading to globally competitivecorporations and associated jobs in new economic sectors;

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Government of Canada: 

* to provide leadership in partnership with Canadian businesses, unions and educationalinstitutions for identifying new business sectors in which Canadian corporations cancreate the necessary advantages to compete internationally thereby supporting stable,quality jobs for all Canadians; and

* to develop the necessary programs to ensure Canadian innovations translate into stable,quality jobs by encouraging and supporting Canadian corporations to grow and competein the global marketplace.(Seniors’Commission)

## Transport Canada’s “Flight and Duty Rules” Reform
 **WHEREAS** 
 

* Transport Canada is pursuing changes to the Flight and Duty Rules that apply to many northern and remote air operators in Canada, said rules having been published July 1 in the Canada Gazette; 

* analysis by the Northern Air Transport Association (NATA) has revealed that many of the changes will have an adverse effect on the efficiency and effectiveness of northern operators who provide critical medevac services;

* there is no evidence to suggest that there has been deterioration in safety in medivac services throughout the north due to incidences of fatigue; 

* the revised rules actually decrease safety for those flying medivac services throughout northern and remote areas given that time behind the controls and frequency of experience flying into challenging air strips will be decreased for pilots;

* management of health and welfare of Canadians living in the north and remote areas is complex with this complexity also experienced in the transportation of the medically challenged to appropriate medical facilities;

* a common element associated with all medical lift actions is the unpredictability of the mission and thus the importance of relying on good judgment by operators with experience and commitment to maintaining the highest possible operational standards; 

* thenew rules appear to be focused on circumstances faced in southern Canada, with no understanding of the unique issues associated with northern and remote aviation.  

**BE IT RESOLVED** : 

* Transport Canada postpone the Gazette process regarding new rules until acomprehensive system safety review is conducted to determine whether current regulations result in scenarios where safety is compromised due to pilot fatigue;

* assuming the outcome of the system safety review is negative, that Transport Canada officials hold a dialogue with northern operators to determine ways to strengthen safety through regulation or adoption and communication of best practices that are unique to northern and remote circumstances;

* Transport Canada inventory the current state of flight infrastructure associated with safe flying in northern and remote environments (approach aids, landing lights and runways of sufficient length), with an eye to setting priorities for infrastructure upgrade or installation funding, as this is a far greater impediment to safe flying in northern areas of Canada;

* Transport Canada pursue the recommendations of the Office of the Auditor General’s 2017, Report 6 regarding establishment of essential airports and definition of “Northern Canada”, matters directly related to safe air transportation throughout Canada’s north.  (Yukon)

## Implementing Universal Access to Necessary Medicines
 **WHEREAS** 
 

* the United Nations and the World Health Organization have declared that all nations should ensure universal access to necessary medicines and Canada does not;

* drug coverage is a fundamental component of receiving proper medical treatment and individuals should have access regardless of financial ability;

* Canada’s public and private drug plans leave many patients with little or no coverage, resulting in 1 out of 10 patients not taking their prescribed medication;

* a moderate increase in public spending would reduce the burden on employers, unions, and private insurers;

* a recent report from the Parliamentary Budget Office, estimates that Pharmacare would save Canadians between $4 billion and $11 billion per year;

* there have been repeated calls to include prescription drugs in Canada’s universal health care system, including:

* Royal Commission on Health Services (1964, chair Justice Emmett Hall)

* National Forum on Health (1997, chair Prime Minister Jean Chrétien),

* Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada (2002, chair Roy Romanow),

* Citizens Reference Panel on Pharmacare (2016, chair Peter MacLeod),

* Several national organisations including Canadian Nurses Association, Canadian Medical Association, Federation of Canadian Municipalities

* “Pharmacare 2020: The future of drug coverage in Canada” (UBC 2015)

* the Liberal Party of Canada adopted a priority resolution at the 2016 National Convention to implement a National Pharmacare plan before 2019;

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada urge the Government of Canada to:

* amend theCanada Health Actby adding, ‘prescription medicines prescribed by a licensed practitioner in accordance with an established formulary’ to the definition of covered services;

* develop, with provincial and territorial cooperation, a universal, single-payer, evidence-based, and sustainable public drug plan, with purchasing power to secure best available pricing, beginning with a list of essential medicines addressing priority health needs and expanding to a comprehensive permanent plan to promote the health and well-being of all Canadians.This Policy Resolution was co-sponsored by the Liberal National Caucus, LPC (BC) and LPC(O).

 ------------------- 

## Visa-Free Business and Tourism Travel for Ukrainian Citizens
 **WHEREAS** 
  

* Canada has a deep and long-standing relationship with Ukraine, including 1.3 million Canadians of Ukrainian descent after 125 years of Ukrainian immigration to Canada, several bilateral programs and, most recently, the Canada-Ukraine Free Trade Agreement (CUFTA);

* Ukrainian-Canadians make up more than 13% of Saskatchewan’s population;

* Canadian-Ukrainian bilateral trade represents nearly $375 million/year and is expected to double with the signing of CUFTA; 

* Western Canada is expected to be the primary beneficiary of CUFTA, with nearly $140 million worth of exports a year from 2014-16; 

* Ukraine unilaterally eliminated the need for short-term visas forCanadian citizens in 2005, while Ukrainian business leaders still require cumbersome visas to engage in business activities in Canada;

* more than one-third of Ukrainian visa applications were denied in the first quarter of 2017; 

* the EU eliminated the needfor visas for Ukrainian citizens in 2017 and has seen a refusal rate of just 0.026% since its implementation (June –Sept. 2017);

* the Liberal Party of Canada committed during the 2015 election that a Liberal government “would work to achieve this goal” [abolition of visas for short-term travel];

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Liberal Government of Canada will eliminate the need for business and tourist visas for Ukrainian citizens with biometric passports for stays of not longer than 90 days.(Saskatchewan)

 ------------------- 

## Women’s Caucus Seniors Resolution
 **WHEREAS** 
 

* 246,000 seniors were living in poverty in Canada in 2015 (below the low-income cut-off after tax (LICO));

* 78 % of those living in poverty are single and 69% of these most vulnerable single seniors are women;

* seniors may face a sudden change in their financial circumstances, due to illness, reduced pension due to spousal death, or the need to carry two housing costs as a result of split residence requirements due to a serious illness of their spouse;

* senior women are more likely to experience a worsening of their financial condition due to a spousal death, as the husband has traditionally been the major family income earner and pensions typically reduce to 60% survivor benefit;

* seniors on OAS and GIS are already the most financially vulnerable;

* a claw back is applied to OAS and GIS when additional income is realized. Subsidized housing is also affected when additional income is realized;

* additional income could be needed for necessary home modification, medical procedureor support program, funeral costs, double housing needs, etc. 

**BE IT RESOLVED** : 

* the Government allows seniors more flexibility to make additional income, without triggering a claw back in their OAS and GIS;

* a sliding scale could be utilized where a percentage is clawed back that increases at certain levels of additional income and is zero below a certain threshold;

* it can also be available only for a limited number of years so as not to trigger an unfair situation with other seniors that have the same income, however may not be getting the same GIS and OAS benefits.(National Caucus)
